# map-container-yashpatel007

<b>Implementation:</b>
This is an implementation of std::Map container using SKIP LIST

<b>How to compile:</b>

      This code has five test files. 
      test_files ={Test1.cpp,Test2.cpp,Minimal.cpp,PerformanceTest.cpp,MorseCodeExample.cpp}
      header_file ={Map.hpp}
    
      In order to compile type:
             $make all
              ........
              ........
      
      This will compile all test_files. Now in order to run Do
             $ ./Test1 or $ ./<file_name>
      
      If you want to only compile specific file type
             $make <file_name>
             
     Compile it the same way as explained above.
    
    
<b>Completion status:</b>
     Every test case is compiling with zero errors and no memory leaks when checked usuing valgrind. There are a few warnings but in            testcode
